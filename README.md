# RomanToInteger
This was an assignment for Week3 of XR Bootcamp.

The assignemnt was the below problem: 

*Roman numerals are as follow:*

*I -> 1*<br />
*V-> 5*<br />
*X -> 10*<br />
*L -> 50*<br />
*C -> 100*<br />
*D -> 500*<br />
*M -> 1000*<br />
*For this example we'll use the simple conversion, where all numbers are*
*translated straight into their integer value (IIII -> 4) but feel free*
*to add the correct conversion as an extra challenge (IV -> 4)*<br />
*Example input:*<br />
*MDLXX     ->    1570*<br />
*CCCLXVII  ->    367*<br />

UI is in unity.
